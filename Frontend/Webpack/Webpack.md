# Webpack
At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

**The Need to Build**
- Modern web-apps grow and require a need for build
- Combine files for `dist`
- a need for compression (minify)
- a need for file-orfer dependencies
- transpilation - change the code to support the older version supported in the browser
- Linting
- Combine js and css files

### Module Systems
- the use of `require()`
