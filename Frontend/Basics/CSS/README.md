## Preprocessing

- CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.

## Positioning
- **fixed**
    - ignores other elements position
    - stays relative to the browser window
