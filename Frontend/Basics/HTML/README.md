## Semantic HTML
- is html that introduces meaning to the web page, rather than just presentation.
For example, a \<p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph.
This is both semantic and presentational, because people know what paragraphs
are and browsers know how to display them.

Examples of semantic HTML tags include the header tags:
- \<h1> through \<h6>,
- \<blockquote>,
- \<code> and \<em>.

There are many more semantic HTML tags that can be used as you build a standards-compliant website.

Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible.

</html>
```
