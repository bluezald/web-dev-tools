# Frontend
- https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#1.1
- A front-end developer architects and develops websites and web applications using web technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), which typically runs on the Open Web Platform or acts as compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e., React Native).

**Headless browsers** are a web browser without a graphical user interface that can be controlled from a command line interface programmatically for the purpose of web page automation (e.g., functional testing, scraping, unit testing, etc.). Think of headless browsers as a browser that you can run programmatically from the command line that can retrieve and traverse web page code.

- A short word of advice on learning. Learn the actual underlying technologies, before learning abstractions. Don't learn jQuery, learn the DOM. Don't learn SASS, learn CSS. Don't learn JSX, learn HTML. Don't learn TypeScript, learn JavaScript. Don't learn Handlebars, learn JavaScript ES6 templates. Don't just use Bootstrap, learn UI patterns.

**DNS**

- Domain names are a key part of the Internet infrastructure. They provide a human-readable address for any web server available on the Internet.

### Service Workers
- is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like push notifications and background sync.

- Note, the service worker is served from the root directory, not from a /scripts/ directory. This is the easiest way to set the scope of your service worker. The scope of the service worker determines which files the service worker controls, in other words, from which path the service worker will intercept requests. The default scope is the location of the service worker file, and extends to all directories below. So if service-worker.js is located in the root directory, the service worker will control requests from all web pages at this domain.

### Token
#### JWT (JSON Web Token)
- is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.

#### OAuth vs JWT
- OAuth 2.0 defines a protocol, i.e. specifies how tokens are transferred, JWT defines a token format.

- OAuth 2.0 and "JWT authentication" have similar appearance when it comes to the (2nd) stage where the Client presents the token to the Resource Server: the token is passed in a header.

- But "JWT authentication" is not a standard and does not specify how the Client obtains the token in the first place (the 1st stage). That is where the perceived complexity of OAuth comes from: it also defines various ways in which the Client can obtain an access token from something that is called an Authorization Server.

- So the real difference is that JWT is just a token format, OAuth 2.0 is a protocol (that may use a JWT as a token format).

# Backend

### cURL
- curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work without user interaction.


# Webhooks
- send a signal when a specified event occurs
- The listener is the URL which receives the webhooks and performs a predefined action after that.
- Webhooks are basically user defined HTTP callbacks (or small code snippets linked to a web application) which are triggered by specific events. Whenever that trigger event occurs in the source site, the webhook sees the event, collects the data, and sends it to the URL specified by you in the form of an HTTP request. You can even configure an event in one site to trigger an action in another site.
- the fundamental difference between API calls and webhooks is that while the former works on request-based output mechanisms, and the latter works on event-based output mechanisms.
- The benefits of webhooks in a nutshell â€“ instant, real-time notifications.

# Memcached
- Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.

# Notes
- **checksum** - the idea of a checksum or a cryptographic hash function might seem complicated and not possibly worth the effort, but we'd like to convince you otherwise! Checksums really aren't that hard to understand or create.

Let's start with a simple example, hopefully showcasing the power of checksums to prove that something has changed. The MD5 checksum for the following phrase is a long string of characters that represent that sentence.

```
This is a test.
120EA8A25E5D487BF68B5F7096440019
```

For our purposes here, they essentially equal each other. However, make even a slight change, like removing just the period, will produce the completely different checksum.

```
This is a test
CE114E4501D2F4E2DCEA3E17B546F339
```

As you can see, even a minuscule change in the file will produce a vastly different checksum, making it very clear that one is not like the other.
