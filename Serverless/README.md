# Serverless
- SaaS - Self-service with 0 operations
- an event driven, utility based, stateless, code execution environment in which you write code and consume services

### What you do in Serverless Systems
- Write less code - // the more code you have the more risk you have
- Define Trigger
- Connect managed services together
- Pay for consumption instead of allocation

### What you Do Not Do
- Pre-provision infrastructure
- Patch infrastructure
- Define Scaling policies
- Store state alongside compute

### Challenges
- Limited lifetime of functions (instance of a function is short-lived)
- Dependency on Remote Storage
- Limits exist for memory size
- Vendor Lock-in

## Use-Cases
- 3-Tier
- Web APIs
- Stream Processing
- Data Pipelines
- Batch Processing
- Infrastructure automation
