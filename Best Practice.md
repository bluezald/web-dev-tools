- Web Page Load Speed - be less than 2 seconds

### Should you version your web-app
- If you resell the same web application to multiple customers, you absolutely should version it.
- If it's a website that's only ever installed in one location, then the need is less dire, but it still likely couldn't hurt. You'd be less susceptible to timezone problems and such, too. Diagnosing an issue in a library version 1.0.2.25 is a lot nicer than hunting down the library build on November 3, 2010 11:15 a.m.
